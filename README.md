📊 Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes the **Bank Marketing** dataset to understand customer behavior and predict responses to direct marketing campaigns. Using **Python** and **Machine Learning**, we perform **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering**, and build predictive models to improve campaign targeting.

3️⃣ Run the Notebook

📄 Dataset

  The dataset comes from the kaggle
  
  Description:
  The data contains details from direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution, with information
  on customer demographics, past campaign contacts, and whether they subscribed to a term deposit.



🛠 Project Workflow

  1. Data Loading & Cleaning
  
     * Handle missing values
     * Remove duplicates
     * Convert data types
  
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
     * Visualize feature distributions
     * Correlation analysis
     * Campaign performance patterns
  
  3. Feature Engineering
  
     * Encoding categorical variables
     * Scaling numeric features
  
  4. Model Building & Evaluation
  
     * Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.
     * Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  
  5. Results & Insights
  
     * Identify top factors influencing customer subscription
     * Recommend strategies for improving campaign success
  

📊 Results

  The best-performing model achieved *high accuracy* in predicting customer subscription decisions.
  Key insights and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
